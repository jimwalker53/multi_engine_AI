# Multi‑Engine AI Architecture

A development blueprint for federating multiple foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, xAI) into a unified **meta‑intelligence** with strong governance.

## Highlights
- Layered architecture: Input ➜ Integration ➜ Emergent Reasoning ➜ Specialized Subsystems ➜ Unified Persona ➜ Risk/Reward.
- Orchestrated, debate‑style reasoning with consensus and conflict arbitration.
- Built‑in governance: kill‑switches, audits, transparency.
